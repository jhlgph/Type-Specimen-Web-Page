                <strong>Contrast and Characteristics</strong>
                <br>
                Dongle is a sans-serif font designed by South Korean designer Fontworks. It features a clean, geometric
                design that balances modern minimalism with a slightly condensed style, making it a great choice for
                both display and body text. The font is optimized for digital interfaces and works well at both small
                and large sizes due to its simplicity and legibility. Its tight letter spacing and slightly rounded
                terminals give it a contemporary feel, while maintaining a sense of warmth and approachability.

                <strong>Anatomy and Typeface Classification</strong>
                <br>
                Dongle is classified as a humanist sans-serif typeface. Its geometric forms provide a clean, uniform
                appearance, while subtle variations in stroke widths add a touch of humanism. The typeface is slightly
                condensed, which makes it highly space-efficient, especially useful in display settings. Its sharp
                angles and uniform letter heights contribute to its legibility, making it a versatile option for both
                headings and paragraphs.

                Summer is the best season to come alive with color and energy. The long days paired with the warm summer
                nights are the perfect combination for outdoor adventures. Anywhere from sunny beach days soaking up the
                sun to singing songs around a bonfire in the evenings.. Whether it’s hiking with friends and family,
                relaxing by the pool, or traveling on a tropical vacation. The opportunities for exploration and
                relaxation are endless when it comes to summer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Spending a hot summer day cooling off at the beach is the heart of a summer experience. The sound of
                crashing waves hitting the shore, the hot and soft touch of sand on your feet and in-between your toes,
                the blazing sun on your back and face, the daydreaming of letting go and relaxing when sunbathing. This
                is the best time to leave behind the stress of everyday life, to be able to live in the moment of pure
                bliss.
                <br>
                <br>
                Summer isn’t just about relaxation; it’s about creating lasting memories with family, friends, and the
                community. From vibrant street festivals and slow strolls through the farmer’s market to outdoor
                concerts and neighborhood barbecues, summer offers countless ways to connect. It’s a time for
                celebrating togetherness, with long evenings filled with good food, laughter, and bonding. These
                connections often last well beyond the season, with the comforting assurance that summer will return,
                bringing with it more moments of joy and togetherness.
